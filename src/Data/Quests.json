Also developed an interactive job-search map that displayed jobs by selected region, as well as an improved search function. I picked up PHP on the fly to make RESTful calls to the database to display this information. The site was developed in both English and Japanese.",

This was important not only to the job seeker, but to the consultants and recruiters who were able to view this data on the backend and make meaningful decisions on how to proceed with certain qualified candidates. Among the tools I made to visualize this data was a mapping system that drew a route from the jobsite to the candidate's listed address to see how feasible it would be to place them. It also compared salary and industry preferences to the job they 'favorited', giving a broader picture of the data at hand to company employees.",
